            draft-reddy-pquip-pqc-signature-migration-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidance for the migration from traditional
   digital signature algorithms to post-quantum signature algorithms
   (PQC).  It compares three models under discussion within the IETF for
   authentication based on signatures in PKI-based protocols: composite
   signatures, dual certificates, and PQ-only certificates.  The goal is
   to help protocol designers, implementers, and operators select an
   approach that balances interoperability, security, and operational
   efficiency during the transition to post-quantum signatures.

1.  Introduction

   The emergence of cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC)
   poses a threat to widely deployed public-key algorithms such as RSA
   and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC).  Post-quantum algorithms are
   being standardized by NIST and other bodies, but migration is not
   immediate.  In the meantime, protocols need to ensure that
   authentication mechanisms remain secure against both classical and
   quantum adversaries.

   The IETF has developed several transition models for use in TLS,
   IKEv2/IPsec, JOSE/COSE, and PKIX:

   *  Composite signatures – A single certificate, key, and signature
      that combines traditional and PQ algorithms
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].
   *  Dual certificates – Two separate certificates, one classical and
      one PQ, that are bound together and validated jointly. (e.g.,
      [RFC9763])
   *  PQ-only certificates – A certificate or signature that uses only a
      PQ algorithm ([I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates] for ML-DSA
      and [I-D.ietf-lamps-x509-slhdsa] for SLH-DSA).

   This document provides guidance on selecting among these approaches,
   depending on deployment context, ecosystem maturity, and security
   requirements.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Composite: A key, certificate, or signature that merges classical and
   PQ algorithms into one object.  Dual certificates: Two independent
   certificates (traditional) and PQ) issued for the same identity,
   presented and validated together.  PQ-only: A certificate or
   signature using only a PQ algorithm.

3.  Motivation for PQC Signatures

   For data authentication, the primary concern is the risk of on-path
   attackers equipped with CRQCs.  Such adversaries could break
   certificate-based authentication mechanisms that rely on traditional
   algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECDSA).  This would allow them to impersonate
   legitimate servers, tricking clients into connecting to the
   attacker’s device instead of the intended target, resulting in
   impersonation and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

   Unlike "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks that target
   confidentiality, this risk directly impacts authentication and trust.
   Once a CRQC is available, the continued use of traditional
   certificates becomes untenable.  In practice, however, the
   availability of a CRQC may not be publicly disclosed.  Similar to a
   zero-day vulnerability, an adversary could secretly exploit CRQC
   capabilities to compromise traditional certificates without alerting
   the wider ecosystem.

   In such a scenario, attackers could suppress PQC certificates and
   present only traditional ones to selected clients, enabling downgrade
   and MitM attacks.  This highlights the critical need to transition
   away from traditional signature algorithms and deploy post-quantum
   signatures for certificate-based authentication, ensuring that
   authentication remains secure even in the presence of CRQCs.

4.  Composite Signatures

   A composite certificate contains both a traditional public key
   algorithm (e.g., ECDSA) and a post-quantum algorithm (e.g., ML-DSA)
   within a single X.509 certificate.  This design enables both
   algorithms to be used in parallel, the traditional component ensures
   compatibility with existing infrastructure, while the post-quantum
   component introduces resistance against future quantum attacks.

   Composite certificates are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].  These combine Post-Quantum
   algorithms like ML-DSA with traditional algorithms such as RSA-
   PKCS#1v1.5, RSA-PSS, ECDSA, Ed25519, or Ed448, to provide additional
   protection against vulnerabilities or implementation bugs in a single
   algorithm.  [I-D.reddy-tls-composite-mldsa] specifies how composite
   signatures, including ML-DSA, are used for TLS 1.3 authentication.

   Composite-trust clients validate a single chain anchored in a
   composite root, without needing parallel chains.

4.1.  Advantages

   *  A single certificate chain is used for both traditional and post-
      quantum keys, simplifying certificate management.
   *  A single composite signature, rooted in one intermediate
      certificate chain, reduces protocol message size compared to
      transmitting multiple separate signatures, each of which would
      require its own certificate chain.
   *  No need to manage or validate multiple parallel certificate
      chains.
   *  No major changes to the base protocol are required to support the
      composite signature approach.

4.2.  Disadvantages

   *  Requires endpoints, relying parties, and CAs to support composite
      public keys and composite signature verification, which are not
      widely deployed at the time of writing of the specification.
   *  Introduces new certificate formats and verification logic that
      will need updates to PKI infrastructure.
   *  Expands the migration landscape to three transition paths:
      1.  Traditional-only,
      2.  Composite (classical + PQ),
      3.  PQ-only.  In contrast, the dual certificate approach requires
          only two paths (traditional and PQ).

5.  Dual Certificates

   Dual certificates rely on issuing two separate certificates for the
   same identity: one with a traditional algorithm (e.g., RSA or ECDSA)
   and one with a post-quantum algorithm (e.g., ML-DSA).  Both
   certificates are presented and validated during authentication,
   providing hybrid assurance without requiring new certificate formats.

5.1.  Advantages

   *  Uses standard, single-algorithm X.509 certificates and chains,
      maximizing compatibility with existing PKI infrastructures.
   *  Maintains clear separation between traditional and post-quantum
      keys.
   *  Requires no changes to certificate validation logic.

5.2.  Disadvantages

   *  Increases protocol message size due to the transmission of
      multiple certificate chains and signatures.
   *  Requires management of multiple certificates.
   *  Requires major changes to the base protocol to support dual
      certificate binding and validation.

6.  PQ-Only Certificates

   PQ-only certificates represent the final stage of migration.  They
   use only a post-quantum algorithm and provide no fallback to
   traditional algorithms.

6.1.  Advantages

   *  Simpler model without the complexity of hybrid assurance.
   *  Forward-looking design, avoiding eventual deprecation of
      traditional algorithms.
   *  Reduced operational burden compared to managing dual or composite
      certificates.

6.2.  Disadvantages

   *  Risk if a deployed PQ algorithm is broken due to a bug.
   *  No interoperability with legacy systems that only support
      traditional algorithms.
   *  Deployment only feasible once PQ algorithms are widely
      standardized and supported across ecosystems.

7.  Operational and Ecosystem Considerations

   Migration to post-quantum authentication requires addressing broader
   ecosystem dependencies, including trust anchors, hardware security
   modules, and constrained devices.

7.1.  Trust Anchors and Transitions

   Trust anchors represent the ultimate root of trust in a PKI.  If
   existing trust anchors are RSA or ECC-based, then new PQ-capable
   trust anchors will need to be distributed.  Operators MUST plan for a
   phased introduction of PQ trust anchors, which may involve:

   *  Rolling out hybrid trust anchors that support both traditional and
      PQC signatures.
   *  Establishing parallel trust anchor hierarchies and phasing out the
      traditional hierarchy once PQ adoption is universal.
   *  Ensuring secure and authenticated distribution of updated trust
      anchors to clients, especially devices that cannot be easily
      updated.

   Deployments migrating from traditional to post-quantum authentication
   must operate with multiple trust anchors for a period of time.  A new
   PQ or composite root may be introduced while the existing traditional
   root remains in place, leading to different trust chain models:

   *  Traditional chain: anchored in a Traditional root (e.g., RSA/
      ECDSA).
   *  PQ chain: anchored in a PQ root (e.g., ML-DSA, SLH-DSA).
   *  Composite chain: anchored in a composite root, with intermediates
      signed using composite algorithms that combine traditional and PQ.
      This forms a distinct new chain, rather than two parallel ones.

   During this coexistence phase, clients generally fall into five
   categories:

   1.  Legacy-only: trust only traditional roots and support only
       traditional algorithms.
   2.  Mixed: trust only traditional roots but support both classical
       and PQ algorithms.  These clients can validate PQ certificates
       only if a PQ intermediate is cross-signed by a traditional root.
   3.  Dual-trust: trust both traditional and PQ roots, supporting both
       algorithm families.
   4.  Composite-trust: trust composite roots and support composite
       algorithms, validating a single chain that integrates traditional
       and PQ signatures.
   5.  PQ-only: trust only PQ roots and support only PQ algorithms.

   The main challenge is that servers cannot easily distinguish between
   mixed clients (2) and dual-trust clients (3), since both advertise PQ
   algorithms, but only dual-trust clients actually recognize PQ roots.
   To ensure compatibility with mixed clients (2), servers may default
   to sending longer PQ chains that include a cross-signed PQ root
   (i.e., a PQ root certificate signed by a traditional root).  However,
   this is unnecessary for dual-trust clients (3), which already trust
   the PQ root directly, and it results in increased message size.

   [I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids] (TAI) addresses this problem by
   allowing clients to explicitly indicate which trust anchors they
   recognize.  This enables servers to select the appropriate chain more
   efficiently, reduce message size, and gain better visibility into
   clients readiness for PQ-only operation.  TAI also allows PQ-capable
   clients to enforce use of PQ chains while still advertising broader
   trust sets to other servers.

   [I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids] (TAI) addresses this problem by
   allowing clients to indicate, on a per-connection basis, which trust
   anchors they recognize.  Servers can use that information to select a
   compatible certificate chain, which reduces unnecessary chain
   elements and gives operators better telemetry on PQC adoption.

   In all cases, the long-term goal is a transition to PQ-only roots and
   certificate chains.  Composite and dual-certificate approaches help
   bridge the gap, but operators must plan carefully for the eventual
   retirement of traditional and composite roots once PQ adoption is
   widespread.

7.2.  Multiple Transitions and Crypto-Agility

   Post-quantum migration is not a single event.  There may be multiple
   transitions over time, as:

   *  Traditional algorithms are gradually retired.
   *  Initial PQ algorithms are standardized and deployed.
   *  New PQ algorithms may replace early ones due to cryptanalysis or
      efficiency improvements.

   Protocols and infrastructures MUST be designed with crypto-agility in
   mind, supporting:

   *  Negotiation of multiple algorithm combinations.
   *  Support phased migration paths, including initial use of PQ/T
      mechanisms, eventual transition to PQ-only certificates, and later
      re-migration to new PQ algorithms as cryptanalysis or security
      policy updates.
   *  Protection against downgrade attacks across multiple transitions.

7.3.  Support from Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

   Many organizations rely on HSMs for secure key storage and
   operations.  Challenges include:

   *  HSMs must be upgraded to support PQ algorithms and, where
      relevant, composite or dual key management models.
   *  PQC algorithms often have larger key sizes and signatures,
      requiring sufficient memory and processing capability in HSMs.
   *  For dual-certificate deployments, HSMs can manage the underlying
      traditional and PQ private keys independently, and no API changes
      are required.  The application layer is responsible for
      coordinating how signatures from both keys are used.  By contrast,
      supporting composite keys and composite signing operations may
      require HSM and API extensions to represent composite key objects
      and perform multi-algorithm signing atomically.

   Without HSM vendor support for PQC, migration may be delayed or
   require software-based fallback solutions, which will weaken
   security.

7.4.  Constrained Devices and IoT Environments

   Constrained environments, such as IoT devices, present unique
   challenges:

   *  Limited memory and bandwidth make large PQ signatures and
      certificate chains difficult to handle.
   *  Firmware update mechanisms may not support frequent trust anchor
      or certificate updates.

   These challenges and potential mitigations are further discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-hsm-constrained], which analyzes PQC deployment
   in resource-constrained devices and hardware security modules.

8.  Transition Considerations

   Determining whether and when to adopt PQC-only certificates, hybrid
   (composite) certificates, or dual certificates depends on several
   factors, including:

   *  Frequency and duration of system upgrades
   *  The expected timeline for CRQC availability
   *  Operational flexibility to enable or disable algorithms

   Deployments with limited flexibility benefit from composite or dual
   certificates.  These approaches mitigate risks associated with delays
   in transitioning to PQC and provide an immediate safeguard against
   zero-day vulnerabilities.  Both approaches improve resilience during
   migration, but they do so in different ways and carry different
   operational trade-offs.

   Composite or dual certificates enhance resilience during the adoption
   of PQC by:

   *  Providing defense in depth: security is maintained as long as
      either the PQ or traditional algorithm remains unbroken.
   *  Reducing exposure to unforeseen vulnerabilities: immediate
      protection against weaknesses in PQC algorithms.

   However, each approach comes with long-term implications.

8.1.  Composite Certificates

   Composite certificates embed both a traditional and a PQC algorithm
   into a single certificate and signature.  However, Once a traditional
   algorithm is no longer secure due to CRQCs, it must be deprecated.
   To complete the transition to a fully quantum-resistant
   authentication model, it will be necessary to provision a new root CA
   certificate that uses only a PQC signature algorithm and public key.
   This new root CA would issue a hierarchy of intermediate
   certificates, each also signed using a PQC algorithm, ultimately
   leading to end-entity certificates that contain only PQC public keys
   and are signed with PQC algorithms.  This ensures that the entire
   certification path from the root of trust to the end entity is
   cryptographically resistant to quantum attacks and does not depend on
   any traditional algorithms.

8.2.  Dual Certificates

   When CRQCs become available, the traditional certificate chain will
   no longer be secure.  At that point, the traditional chain must be
   removed, and the protocol configuration updated so that only the PQC
   certificate chain is presented and validated.  This requires careful
   coordination during the transition, since legacy clients that cannot
   process PQC certificates will lose access once the traditional chain
   is withdrawn.  Dual-certificate deployments therefore defer, but do
   not avoid, the need to update protocol configurations and move to a
   PQ-only environment.

8.3.  Loss of Strong Unforgeability in Composite and Dual Certificates

   A deployment may choose to continue using the same composite or dual-
   certificate configuration even after the traditional algorithm has
   been broken by the advent of a CRQC.  While this may simplify
   operations by avoiding re-provisioning of trust anchors, it
   introduces a significant risk: security properties degrade once one
   component of the hybrid is no longer secure.

   In composite certificates, the signature will no longer achieve
   Strong Unforgeability (SUF) (Section 10.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers], Section 11.2 of
   [I-D.reddy-tls-composite-mldsa]).  A CRQC can forge the broken
   traditional signature component (s1_) over a message (m).  That
   forged component can then be combined with the valid post-quantum
   component (s2) to produce a new composite signature (m, (s1_, s2))
   that verifies successfully, thereby violating SUF.

   In dual-certificate deployments where the client mandates that both a
   traditional and a PQ chain be provided, the SUF property is likewise
   not achieved.

9.  Migration Guidance

   *  Experimental (individual drafts): Dual certificates have been
      proposed as a migration mechanism (e.g.,
      [I-D.hu-ipsecme-pqt-hybrid-auth], [I-D.yusef-tls-pqt-dual-certs],
      [I-D.bonnell-lamps-chameleon-certs]), but at the time of writing
      none of the relevant IETF working groups have adopted this
      approach.  Dual certificates require significant protocol changes
      to bind and validate both certificates correctly (e.g., extensions
      in TLS, multiple CERT payload handling in IKEv2).
   *  Medium-term (standards-track): Composite signatures enable tighter
      integration once ecosystem support (PKIX, IPSec, JOSE/COSE, TLS)
      is mature.  Composite signatures are already being standardized in
      the LAMPS WG ([I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs]) and leveraged in
      [I-D.reddy-tls-composite-mldsa] for TLS,
      [I-D.hu-ipsecme-pqt-hybrid-auth] for IPsec/IKEv2, and
      [I-D.prabel-jose-pq-composite-sigs] for JOSE/COSE.
   *  Long-term: PQ-only certificates are the final goal, once PQ
      algorithms are well-established, trust anchors have been updated,
      HSMs and devices natively support PQ operations, and traditional
      algorithms are fully retired.

10.  Security Considerations

   Hybrid approaches (composite or dual certificates) are designed to
   provide defense in depth during the migration to PQC.  Their goal is
   to ensure that authentication remains secure as long as at least one
   of the algorithms in use remains unbroken.  However, several
   important security considerations arise.

10.1.  Downgrade Attacks

   Implementations must ensure downgrade protection so that an adversary
   cannot suppress PQ or hybrid certificates and force reliance solely
   on traditional algorithms.  This is especially important in scenarios
   where a CRQC is available but not publicly disclosed.  Without
   downgrade protection, a MitM attacker could impersonate servers by
   presenting only traditional certificates even when PQ options are
   supported.

10.2.  Strong Unforgeability versus Existential Unforgeability

   In composite and dual-certificate deployments, once one component
   algorithm is broken (e.g., the traditional algorithm under a CRQC),
   the overall scheme no longer achieves SUF.  While "Existential
   Unforgeability (EUF)" is still preserved by the PQ component, the
   loss of SUF means that hybrid mechanisms will have be retired once
   traditional algorithms are no longer secure.

10.3.  Operational Risks

   Managing multiple certificate paths (composite, dual, and PQ-only)
   can introduce misconfigurations and operational errors.  For example,
   a server might inadvertently remove a PQ chain too early, or continue
   using a hybrid certificate after a traditional algorithm is broken,
   undermining security.  Clear operational guidance and automated
   monitoring tools are necessary to avoid such pitfalls.
