 Guidance for Migration to Composite, Dual, or PQC-Only Authentication
            draft-reddy-pquip-pqc-signature-migration-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidance for migration from traditional
   digital signature algorithms to post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)
   signature algorithms.  It compares three models under discussion in
   the IETF for PKI-based protocols: composite certificates, dual
   certificates, and PQC-only certificates.  The goal is to help
   operators and engineers working on cryptographic libraries, network
   security, and PKI/key management infrastructure select an approach
   that balances interoperability, security, and operational efficiency
   during the transition to post-quantum authentication.

1.  Introduction

   The emergence of cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC)
   poses a threat to widely deployed public-key algorithms such as RSA
   and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC).  Post-quantum algorithms are
   being standardized by NIST and other bodies, but migration is not
   immediate.  In the meantime, protocols need to ensure that
   authentication mechanisms remain secure against both classical and
   quantum adversaries.

   For data authentication, the primary concern is the risk of on-path
   attackers equipped with CRQCs.  Such adversaries could break
   certificate-based mechanisms that rely on traditional algorithms
   (e.g., RSA, ECDSA), allowing them to impersonate servers and clients,
   and mount man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  In this scenario,
   attackers could also suppress PQC certificates and present only
   traditional ones, enabling downgrades.  These risks highlight the
   need to transition certificate-based authentication toward post-
   quantum security, using hybrid signature schemes as an intermediate
   step before PQC-only adoption.

   The IETF has developed two hybrid transition models for use in TLS,
   IKEv2/IPsec, JOSE/COSE, and PKIX:

   *  Composite certificates: A single X.509 certificate that contains a
      composite public key and composite signature, combining a
      traditional and a PQC algorithm
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].
   *  Dual certificates: Two separate certificates, one traditional and
      one PQC algorithm, issued for the same identity, presented and
      validated together [RFC9763].

   Another approach is using a Post-Quantum certificate,

   *  PQC-only certificates: A certificate or signature that uses only a
      PQ algorithm ([I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates] for ML-DSA
      and [I-D.ietf-lamps-x509-slhdsa] for SLH-DSA).

   This document provides guidance on selecting among the two hybrid
   certificate models and the PQC-only model depending on the deployment
   context, the readiness of the supporting ecosystem, and security
   requirements.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms "composite certificates", "dual
   certificates", and "PQC-only certificates" as introduced in the
   Introduction.

   Composite: A key, certificate, or signature that merges traditional
   and PQC algorithms into one object.

   The terms hybrid signature scheme and hybrid signature are used as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums].

3.  Motivation for PQC Signatures

   Unlike "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks that target
   confidentiality, this risk directly impacts authentication and trust.
   Once a CRQC is available, the continued use of traditional
   certificates becomes untenable.  In practice, however, the
   availability of a CRQC may not be publicly disclosed.  Similar to a
   zero-day vulnerability, an adversary could secretly exploit CRQC
   capabilities to compromise traditional certificates without alerting
   the wider ecosystem.

   Addressing this risk requires replacing traditional signatures with
   PQC signatures, which in turn demands ecosystem-wide upgrades
   involving cryptographic libraries, HSMs, TPMs, CAs, intermediate CAs,
   and dependent protocols.  Because these transitions take years of
   planning, coordination, and investment, preparations will have to
   begin well before a CRQC is publicly known.

4.  Composite certificates

   A composite certificate contains both a traditional public key
   algorithm (e.g., ECDSA) and a post-quantum algorithm (e.g., ML-DSA)
   within a single X.509 certificate.  This design enables both
   algorithms to be used in parallel, the traditional component ensures
   compatibility with existing infrastructure, while the post-quantum
   component introduces resistance against future quantum attacks.

   Composite certificates are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].  These combine Post-Quantum
   algorithms like ML-DSA with traditional algorithms such as RSA-
   PKCS#1v1.5, RSA-PSS, ECDSA, Ed25519, or Ed448, to provide additional
   protection against vulnerabilities or implementation bugs in a single
   algorithm.  [I-D.reddy-tls-composite-mldsa] specifies how composite
   certificates are used for TLS 1.3 authentication.  In this case,
   relying parties validate a single certification path anchored in a
   multi-algorithm trust anchor, without the need for parallel chains.

4.1.  Advantages

   *  A single certificate chain supports both traditional and PQC
      algorithms, thereby simplifying certificate management.
   *  A single composite certificate, conveyed within one certificate
      chain, reduces protocol message size compared to transmitting
      multiple separate signatures, each requiring its own certificate
      chain.
   *  No need to manage or validate multiple parallel certificate
      chains.
   *  No significant modifications to the base protocol are required to
      support the composite approach.

4.2.  Disadvantages

   *  Requires clients, servers, and CAs to support composite public
      keys and composite signature verification, which are not widely
      deployed at the time of writing of the specification.
   *  Introduces new certificate formats and signature generation and
      verification mechanisms, requiring updates to PKI infrastructure.
   *  Requires multiple migration steps, with deployments moving from
      Traditional-only to Composite, and later from Composite to PQC-
      only.

5.  Dual Certificates

   Dual certificates rely on issuing two separate certificates for the
   same identity: one with a traditional algorithm (e.g., RSA or ECDSA)
   and one with a post-quantum algorithm (e.g., ML-DSA).  Both
   certificates are presented and validated during authentication,
   providing hybrid assurance without requiring new certificate formats.

5.1.  Advantages

   *  Uses standard, single-algorithm X.509 certificates and chains,
      maximizing compatibility with existing PKI infrastructures.
   *  Maintains clear separation between traditional and PQC keys.
   *  Requires only one migration step, with deployments moving from
      Traditional-only to Dual certificates, and later removing support
      for Traditional certificates.
   *  Better suited for multi-tenancy cases, where different tenants may
      prefer different combinations of traditional and PQ algorithms,
      avoiding the need for consensus on a composite set.
   *  Facilitates simpler future transitions to new PQC algorithms,
      since a new PQC certificate can simply be issued and paired with
      an existing certificate, without requiring new composite
      definitions.

5.2.  Disadvantages

   *  Increases protocol message size due to the transmission of
      multiple certificate chains and signatures.
   *  Requires management of multiple certificates.
   *  Requires significant protocol changes to support validation of two
      end-entity certificates and to ensure they are cryptographically
      bound to the same identity, as protocols typically validate only a
      single certificate.
   *  Complicates debugging and troubleshooting, since validation
      failures may arise from either chain.
   *  Increases operational cost, as operators must obtain and manage
      two end-entity certificates from CAs, which can be significant in
      large-scale deployments.

6.  PQC-Only Certificates

   PQC-only certificates represent the final stage of migration.  They
   use only a post-quantum algorithm and provide no fallback to
   traditional algorithms.

6.1.  Advantages

   *  Simpler model without the complexity of hybrid signature scheme.
   *  Forward-looking design, avoiding eventual deprecation of
      traditional algorithms.
   *  Reduced operational burden compared to managing dual or composite
      certificates.

6.2.  Disadvantages

   *  Risk if a deployed PQC algorithm is broken due to a bug.
   *  No interoperability with legacy systems that only support
      traditional algorithms.
   *  Deployment is only feasible once PQC algorithms are standardized
      and broadly supported across the ecosystem.

7.  Negotiation of Authentication Schemes

   During the transition, endpoints may support multiple authentication
   schemes (e.g., traditional, composite, dual, or PQC-only).  Clients
   advertise their supported schemes using the protocol's negotiation
   mechanism (for example, the 'signature_algorithms' extension in TLS
   [RFC8446]), and servers select from the client's list or fail the
   authentication if no common option is available.  In practice,
   deployments are expected to prefer PQC-only or hybrid signature
   scheme over traditional ones, with the choice between PQC-only and
   hybrid signature scheme influenced by regulatory mandates or by
   whether defense-in-depth is prioritized.

8.  Operational and Ecosystem Considerations

   Migration to post-quantum authentication requires addressing broader
   ecosystem dependencies, including trust anchors, hardware security
   modules, and constrained devices.

8.1.  Trust Anchors and Transitions

   Trust anchors represent the ultimate root of trust in a PKI.  If
   existing trust anchors are RSA or ECC-based, then new PQC-capable
   trust anchors will need to be distributed.  Operators will have to
   plan for a phased introduction of PQC trust anchors, which may
   involve:

   *  Rolling out composite trust anchors that support both traditional
      and PQC signatures.
   *  Establishing parallel trust anchor hierarchies and phasing out the
      traditional hierarchy once PQC adoption is universal.
   *  Ensuring secure and authenticated distribution of updated trust
      anchors to clients, especially devices that cannot be easily
      updated.

   Deployments migrating from traditional to post-quantum authentication
   may have to operate with multiple trust anchors for a period of time.
   A new PQC or composite root may be introduced, or alternatively a PQ
   intermediate may be added beneath an existing traditional root,
   leading to different trust chain models:

   *  Traditional chain: anchored in a Traditional root (e.g., RSA/
      ECDSA), which may issue a PQC intermediate.
   *  PQC chain: anchored in a PQC root (e.g., ML-DSA, SLH-DSA).
   *  Parallel roots: both a traditional root and a PQC root are
      distributed as trust anchors, with separate hierarchies operating
      in parallel until the traditional root can be phased out.
   *  Composite chain: anchored in a composite root and using composite
      algorithms, with a single certificate chain that combines
      traditional and PQC public keys and signatures.  This forms a
      distinct chain, rather than two parallel ones.

   During this coexistence phase, clients generally fall into five
   categories:

   1.  Legacy-only: trust only traditional roots and support only
       traditional algorithms.
   2.  Mixed: trust only traditional roots but support both traditional
       and PQC algorithms.  These clients can validate PQC certificates
       only if a PQC intermediate is cross-signed by a traditional root.
   3.  Dual-trust: trust both traditional and PQC roots, supporting both
       algorithm families.
   4.  Composite-trust: trusts composite root and support composite
       algorithms, validating a single chain that integrates traditional
       and PQ signatures.
   5.  PQC-only: trust only PQC roots and support only PQC algorithms.

   The main challenge is that servers cannot easily distinguish between
   mixed clients (2) and dual-trust clients (3), since both advertise
   PQC algorithms, but only dual-trust clients actually recognize PQC
   roots.  To ensure compatibility with mixed clients (2), servers may
   default to sending longer PQC chains that include a cross-signed PQC
   root (i.e., a PQC root certificate signed by a traditional root).
   However, this is unnecessary and even counterproductive for dual-
   trust clients (3), which already trust the PQC root directly; such
   clients will fail to validate the cross-signed PQC root.  For dual-
   trust clients, including the cross-signed PQC root only increases
   message size and introduces validation errors.

   [I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids] (TAI) addresses this problem by
   allowing clients to indicate, on a per-connection basis, which trust
   anchors they recognize.  Servers can use that information to select a
   compatible certificate chain, reducing unnecessary chain elements and
   providing operators with better telemetry on PQC adoption.  TAI also
   enables PQC-capable clients to tell PQC-aware servers exactly which
   PQC trust anchors they recognize, while still supporting traditional
   roots for compatibility with legacy servers.

   In all cases, the long-term goal is a transition to PQC-only roots
   and certificate chains.  Hybrid signature schemes help bridge the
   gap, but operators will have to plan carefully for the eventual
   retirement of traditional and composite roots once PQC adoption is
   widespread.

8.2.  Multiple Transitions and Crypto-Agility

   Post-quantum migration is not a single event.  There may be multiple
   transitions over time, as:

   *  Traditional signature algorithms are gradually retired.
   *  Initial PQC signature algorithms are standardized and deployed.
   *  New PQC signature algorithms may replace early ones due to
      cryptanalysis or efficiency improvements.

   Protocols and infrastructures will have to be designed with crypto-
   agility in mind, supporting:

   *  Negotiation of standalone PQC algorithms and hybrid signature
      schemes.
   *  Phased migration paths, including initial use of hybrid signature
      schemes, eventual transition to PQC-only certificates, and later
      migration to new PQC algorithms as cryptanalysis or security
      policy guidance evolves.
   *  Protection against downgrade attacks across all transition phases.

8.3.  Support from Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

   Many organizations rely on HSMs for secure key storage and
   operations.  Challenges include:

   *  HSMs must be upgraded to support PQC algorithms and, where
      relevant, composite or dual key management models.
   *  PQC algorithms often have larger key sizes and signatures,
      requiring sufficient memory and processing capability in HSMs.
   *  For dual certificate deployments, HSMs can manage the underlying
      traditional and PQC private keys independently, and no API changes
      are required.  The security protocol is responsible for
      coordinating how signatures from both keys are used.  By contrast,
      supporting composite keys and composite signing operations will
      require HSM and API extensions to represent composite private keys
      and perform multi-algorithm signing atomically.

   Without HSM vendor support for PQC, migration may be delayed or
   require software-based fallback solutions, which will weaken
   security.

8.4.  Constrained Devices and IoT Environments

   Constrained environments, such as IoT devices, present unique
   challenges for PQC deployment due to limited processing, memory, and
   bandwidth.  Guidance is provided in
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-hsm-constrained], including the use of seeds for
   efficient key generation, PQC-protected firmware updates, and other
   techniques for enabling PQC in lightweight HSMs and resource-
   constrained devices.

9.  Transition Considerations

   A deployment will typically adopt one of three models, PQC-only
   certificates, dual certificates, or composite certificates.

   The choice depends on several factors, including:

   *  Frequency and duration of system upgrades
   *  The expected timeline for CRQC availability
   *  Operational flexibility to deploy, enable, and retire PQC
      algorithms
   *  Availability of automated certificate provisioning mechanisms
      (e.g., ACME [RFC8555], CMP [RFC9810])

   Deployments with limited flexibility benefit from hybrid signature
   schemes.  These approaches mitigate risks associated with delays in
   transitioning to PQC and provide an immediate safeguard against zero-
   day vulnerabilities.  Both approaches improve resilience during
   migration, but they do so in different ways and carry different
   operational trade-offs.

   Hybrid signature schemes enhance resilience during the adoption of
   PQC by:

   *  Providing defense in depth: security is maintained as long as
      either the PQC or traditional algorithm remains unbroken.
   *  Reducing exposure to unforeseen vulnerabilities: immediate
      protection against weaknesses in PQC algorithms.

   However, each approach comes with long-term implications.

9.1.  Composite Certificates

   Composite certificate embeds both a traditional and a PQC algorithm
   into a single certificate and signature.  However, once a traditional
   algorithm is no longer secure against CRQCs, it will have to be
   deprecated.  For discussion of the security impact in security
   protocols (e.g., TLS, IKEv2) versus artifact-signing use cases, see
   Section Section 9.3.

   To complete the transition to a fully quantum-resistant
   authentication model, operators will need a PQC CA root and CA
   intermediates, resulting in PQC-only end-entity certificates.

   Protocol configurations (e.g., TLS, IKEv2) will likewise need to be
   updated to negotiate only PQC-based authentication, ensuring that the
   entire certification path and protocol handshake are
   cryptographically resistant to quantum attacks and no longer depend
   on any traditional algorithms.

9.2.  Dual Certificates

   When CRQCs become available, the traditional certificate chain will
   no longer be secure.  At that point, the traditional chain must be
   removed, and the protocol configuration updated so that only the PQC
   certificate chain is presented and validated.  This requires careful
   coordination during the transition, since legacy clients that cannot
   process PQC certificates will lose access once the traditional chain
   is withdrawn.  Dual certificate deployments therefore defer, but do
   not avoid, the need to update protocol configurations and move to a
   PQC-only environment.

9.3.  Loss of Strong Unforgeability in Composite and Dual Certificates

   A deployment may choose to continue using a composite or dual
   certificate configuration even after a traditional algorithm has been
   broken by the advent of a CRQC.  While this may simplify operations
   by avoiding re-provisioning of trust anchors, it introduces a
   significant risk: security properties degrade once one component of
   the hybrid is no longer secure.

   In composite certificates, the composite signature will no longer
   achieve Strong Unforgeability under chosen message attack (SUF-CMA)
   (see Section 10.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers] and
   Section 10.2 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs]).  A CRQC can
   forge the broken traditional signature component (s1_) over a message
   (m).  That forged component can then be combined with the valid post-
   quantum component (s2) to produce a new composite signature (m, (s1_,
   s2)) that verifies successfully, thereby violating SUF-CMA.

   In dual certificate deployments where the client requires both a
   traditional and a PQC chain, the SUF-CMA property is likewise not
   achieved once the traditional algorithm is broken.

   In protocols such as TLS and IKEv2, a composite signature remains
   secure against impersonation as long as at least one component
   algorithm remains unbroken, because verification succeeds only if
   every component signature validates over the same canonical message
   defined by the authentication procedure.  However, in artifact
   signing use cases, the break of a single component does not enable
   forgery of a composite signature but does enable "repudiation":
   multiple distinct composite signatures can exist for the same
   artifact, undermining the "one signature, one artifact" guarantee.
   This creates ambiguity about which composite signature is authentic,
   complicating long-term non-repudiation guarantees.

   Hybrid signature schemes should not be used for artifact signing
   (e.g., software packages), since the loss of SUF-CMA makes them
   unsuitable for long-term non-repudiation.  In security protocols
   (e.g., TLS, IKEv2), hybrid signature schemes may continue to function
   for a limited time after a CRQC is realized, since they still provide
   impersonation resistance as long as one component algorithm remains
   secure.  This situation does not constitute a zero-day vulnerability
   requiring an immediate upgrade.  However, operators will have to plan
   an orderly migration to PQC-only certificates in order to restore
   SUF-CMA security guarantees.

10.  Migration Guidance

   *  Long-term to adopt and deploy:: Dual certificates have been
      standardized in [RFC9763].  However, at the time of writing, none
      of the security protocols (e.g., TLS, IKEv2, JOSE/COSE) have
      adopted this mechanism.  The proposals are being discussed in
      IKEv2 ([I-D.hu-ipsecme-pqt-hybrid-auth]), TLS
      ([I-D.yusef-tls-pqt-dual-certs]), and in the form of paired
      certificates with a single certificate
      ([I-D.bonnell-lamps-chameleon-certs]).
   *  Medium-term to adopt and deploy: Composite certificates become
      viable once ecosystem support across PKIX, IPsec, JOSE/COSE, and
      TLS is mature.  Composite ML-DSA is already being standardized in
      the LAMPS WG ([I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs]) and leveraged in
      [I-D.reddy-tls-composite-mldsa] for TLS,
      [I-D.hu-ipsecme-pqt-hybrid-auth] for IPsec/IKEv2, and
      [I-D.prabel-jose-pq-composite-sigs] for JOSE/COSE.
   *  Long-to-medium term to adopt and deploy: PQC-only certificates are
      the final goal, once PQ algorithms are well-established, trust
      anchors have been updated, HSMs and devices support PQC
      operations, and traditional algorithms are fully retired.  Work to
      enable PQC signatures is already underway in JOSE/COSE
      [I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium], TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-mldsa], and IPsec
      [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-pqc-auth].

11.  Use of SLH-DSA in PQC-Only Deployments

   SLH-DSA does not introduce any new hardness assumptions beyond those
   inherent to its underlying hash functions.  It builds upon
   established cryptographic foundations, making it a reliable and
   robust digital signature scheme for a post-quantum world.  While
   attacks on lattice-based schemes such as ML-DSA are currently
   hypothetical, if realized they could compromise the security of those
   schemes.  SLH-DSA would remain unaffected by such attacks due to its
   distinct mathematical foundations, helping to ensure the ongoing
   security of systems and protocols that rely on it for digital
   signatures.  Unlike ML-DSA, SLH-DSA is not defined for use in
   composite certificates and is intended to be deployed directly in
   PQC-only certificate hierarchies.

   SLH-DSA may be used for both end-entity and CA certificates.  It
   provides strong post-quantum security but produces larger signatures
   than ML-DSA or traditional algorithms.  At security levels 1, 3, and
   5, two parameter sets are available:

   *  "Small" (s) variants minimize signature size, ranging from 7856
      bytes (128-bit) to 29792 bytes (256-bit).
   *  "Fast" (f) variants optimize key generation and signing speed,
      with signature sizes from 17088 bytes (128-bit) to 29792 bytes
      (256-bit), but slower verification performance.

   Because of these large signatures, SLH-DSA will increase handshake
   size in protocols such as TLS 1.3 or IKEv2.  However, the impact on
   performance is minimal for long-lived connections or large data
   transfers, where handshake overhead is amortized over session
   duration (e.g., DTLS-in-SCTP in 3GPP N2 interfaces, or signature
   authentication in IKEv2 using PQC [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-pqc-auth]).

   In deployments where minimizing handshake size is critical, operators
   may prefer SLH-DSA for root and intermediate certificates while using
   smaller- signature algorithms (e.g., ML-DSA) in end-entity
   certificates or in the "CertificateVerify" message.

   Mechanisms such as Abridged TLS Certificate Chains
   [I-D.ietf-tls-cert-abridge] and Suppressing CA Certificates
   [I-D.kampanakis-tls-scas-latest] reduce handshake size by limiting
   certificate exchange to only end-entity certificates.  In such cases,
   intermediate certificates are assumed to be known to the peer,
   allowing the use of larger signature algorithms like SLH-DSA for
   those certificates without adding overhead to the handshake.

12.  Security Considerations

   Hybrid signature schemes are designed to provide defense in depth
   during the migration to PQC.  Their goal is to ensure that
   authentication remains secure as long as at least one of the
   algorithms in use remains unbroken.  However, several important
   security considerations arise.

12.1.  Downgrade Attacks

   Implementations must ensure downgrade protection so that an adversary
   cannot suppress PQC or hybrid schemes and force reliance solely on
   traditional algorithms.  This is especially important in scenarios
   where a CRQC is available but not publicly disclosed.  Without
   downgrade protection, a MitM attacker could impersonate servers by
   presenting only traditional certificates even when PQC certificates
   are supported.

12.2.  Strong Unforgeability versus Existential Unforgeability

   In hybrid signature schemes, once one component algorithm is broken
   (e.g., the traditional algorithm under a CRQC), the overall scheme no
   longer achieves SUF-CMA.  While Existential Unforgeability under
   chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) (see Section 10.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers]) is still preserved by the PQC
   component, meaning that an adversary who can obtain signatures on
   arbitrary messages still cannot forge a valid PQC signature on any
   new message that was not previously signed.  The loss of SUF-CMA
   means that hybrid mechanisms will have be eventually retired once
   traditional algorithms are no longer secure.

12.3.  Operational Risks

   Managing multiple certificate paths (composite, dual, and PQC-only)
   increases the risk of misconfiguration and operational errors.  For
   example, a server might continue using a hybrid signature scheme
   after the traditional algorithm is broken, fail to revoke traditional
   certificates that are no longer secure, or select the wrong chain for
   a given client, resulting in clients receiving a certificate path
   they cannot validate.

   Clear operational guidance and automated monitoring are essential to
   minimize these risks.  Operators need best practices for certificate
   lifecycle and migration planning, along with automated checks to
   ensure PQC chains remain present, valid, and not replaced by weaker
   alternatives.

13.  IANA Considerations
